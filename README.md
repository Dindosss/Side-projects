Here are my side projects that consists of apis, websites and any other endeavour i decide to go on. 
My first api is a simple Rest api that collects cars details from university database as well as stores customer information into a seperate database. It can do sorting and encryption is used in api when validating user.
Spotify api:
This is api that gets information from spotifys api and produces random song with user can want to find out from, Why have i created this api. Well its part of a much bigger project that tries to introduce new songs and artists to users.
